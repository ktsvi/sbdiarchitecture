# SBDI architecture with GAMA simulation platform

Key-words: Agent-based Modelling, BDI, Spatial Knowledge Representation, RCC Theory, Practical Reasoning, Decision-Making, Land Use Simulation.

This repository contains the experimentation codes of SBDI architecture build in Eclipse platform from the GAMA open source. It's a pilot implementation of the agent architecture proposed is tested in the GAMA simulation platform. We have then experimented with this architecture on a land use case study where the performances of different kinds of agents are evaluated and compared in simulation. Scientifically, the encouraging results presented demonstrate the importance of the spatial dimension in the model validity and help to fix a base of agent development pool that improves the agent technology applied to the land use modeling problems 

To deploye it, it is important to use eclipse, then download the opensource of GAMA, import our project in the same repository and launch to open a new instance of GAMA for tests.
